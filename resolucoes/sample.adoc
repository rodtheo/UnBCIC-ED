== Equations in normal blocks

[latexmath]
++++
k_{n+1} = n^2 + k_n^2 - k_{n-1}

Some useful text! Formula for quadratic root:

[stem]
++++
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
++++

Inline equation works too! latexmath:[a^2+b^2=c^2]. Or as stem
stem:[a^2+b^2=c^2]. Pretty nice, huh?

== Equations in table cells

Equations in asciidoc style table cells work, too!
